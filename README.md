# fitness_tracker_servlet_maven

This is the code for the website www.simplfitness.co.uk it uses Java Servlets and a PostgreSQL database on the backend with pure JavaScript and HTML5/CSS on the frontend.

In the future I want to redo a lot of the frontend using Angular 2.0, as this website is not feature complete yet before I go any further with it I need a better way of creating pretty things in a browser. Angular seems to be the answer to that.
