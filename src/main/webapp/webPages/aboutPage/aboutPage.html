                                    <p>This is a simple website you can use to track the food you eat and its nutritional content. In the future you may be able to track workout progress on this site as well. It is currently not finished though, there are a number of known bugs and rough edges that still need to be ironed out.</p>

                                    <h3>Who made it and why?</h3>
                                    <p>My name is Maximilian Power and I am studying Q62 Computing & IT with a software development specialization. I made this website as part of my final years open university project for module TM470. I liked the idea of creating something I could use and that I would enjoy creating. I was inspired by websites like steamcharts.com (it tracks the popularity of games on steam) and I knew I wanted to make some kind of website as well but I didnt want to bite off more than I could chew. I figured a simple website to track nutrition would be a fun project and I would learn a lot about web development in the process which would be fantastic since I knew very little about it at the beginning!. Also hopefully I will be able to polish this site enough to put it on my CV and demonstrate my capabilities to a potential employer.</p>

                                    <h3>How does this site work?</h3>
                                    <p>The frontend of the website uses the bootstrap framework, HTML and JavaScript. The backend is plain old Java servlets which communicate with a Postgresql database. The website is hosted using TomEE on a debian 8.2 server I set up myself.</p>
